### What this project is

A self-hosted toolkit that downloads videos from YouTube and many other sites
(Instagram, Facebook, X, TikTok, Bilibili, and more). It runs as a small set of
containers you start with simple commands. There are three ways to use it:

- **Боба landing page** — a friendly welcome page that walks you through signing
  in to your sites and uploading your cookies so login-protected videos can be
  downloaded.
- **Dashboard** — a modern web app where you paste a link, pick quality, and
  watch your downloads progress, see history, and manage cookies.
- **Command line** (`./download`) — for power users who prefer the terminal.

An optional VPN tunnel can route all downloads privately, and an auto-update
service keeps the container images fresh.

### What works today

- Downloading videos through the dashboard, the classic MeTube interface, or the
  command line.
- The cookie sign-in flow (upload your `cookies.txt`, see how fresh it is per
  site).
- The download queue with live status (waiting, preparing, downloading,
  finishing, done, error, cancelled) and a history list that even remembers
  cancelled items.
- Starting, stopping, restarting, and checking the health of the whole system
  with one command each.
- An optional VPN mode and automatic image updates.

### What is recorded so far

- **Six screens are now video-confirmed** by a real captured screenshot/transcript
  of the genuinely-running system: the Dashboard, the Боба landing page, the
  classic MeTube interface, the post-processing status page, the `./status` health
  command, and the `./download` command (which shows its usage and the detected
  container runtime). Each was examined and confirmed to be working — no blank,
  frozen, or error screens. These confirm the screens *look right and respond*.
- **One full end-to-end *flow* is now confirmed too:** downloading a video all the
  way to a web-ready copy. We watched the live pipeline finish one more item (its
  "done" count went up by one) and verified the newly-produced web-ready file is a
  genuine, playable video (correct H.264 format, 1920×1080, ~2 hours long, fast-start
  enabled). The two flows still to record are MP3 audio extraction (no audio job has
  run recently, so no MP3 file exists to confirm yet) and the cookie upload
  start-to-finish — the latter needs the operator's own fresh login cookies, and
  uploading test cookies would overwrite the real ones, so it waits on the operator.
- Every other feature still reads **"PENDING — not yet recorded."** This is the
  honest status, not a placeholder.

### What is now built (was "planned")

- The **media post-processing** capability is **now built and shipped** (version
  `ytdlp-1.4.0`): it makes web-ready video copies (6+ already on disk), can pull
  out MP3 audio, and reports live pipeline progress through a status page.
- Still genuinely **not built**: a dashboard screen that shows pipeline progress
  visually, and a "resume an interrupted download" feature.
- The automated tests and challenges exist and cover the features, but a full,
  clean, evidence-captured test run is not yet on record in this document, so most
  verdicts read "PENDING_FORENSICS" rather than a confirmed PASS.

### Team actions

- None blocking. The VPN mode needs the operator's own VPN credentials to run
  live, but the code path is in place.
- Next milestone: record the end-to-end **flow** videos (download → web-ready,
  cookie upload) so those features move from render-confirmed to flow-confirmed.

  `landing-vpn` / `landing-no-vpn`, `yt-dlp-cli` / `yt-dlp-cli-vpn`, `dashboard`,
  `watchtower`, `media_postprocessor` (container `media-postprocessor`,

- **Dashboard (Angular 17 + nginx):** `dashboard/src/app/` — `app.routes.ts`
  (`''` download-form, `queue`, `history`, `cookies`, `**` not-found);
  components `download-form/`, `queue/` (STATE_META: pending, preparing,
  downloading, postprocessing, finished, error, aborted), `history/`
  (aborted-history merge via `abortedToDownloadInfo`), `cookies/`, `navbar/`
  (profile badge), `error-boundary/`, `not-found/`; services
  `metube.service.ts` (typed API, no `any`), `error-interceptor.service.ts`.

  `stop`, `status`, `download`, `check-vpn`, `restart`, `cleanup`;
  `prepare-release.sh`, `setup-auto-update`, `update-images`. Runtime detection
  via `lib/container-runtime.sh`.

  CLI-agent feature dirs).

### Status vocabulary (§11.4.45 closed set)

`PASS` / `FAIL` / `SKIP` / `PENDING_FORENSICS` / `OPERATOR-BLOCKED`.

- Implemented-and-wired features: **`PENDING_FORENSICS`** — code present + test
  files exist, but no clean-baseline full-suite run with captured runtime
  evidence is on record in this revision (per §11.4.6 an unproven PASS is
  forbidden).
- Planned features (§7 of `Status.md`): **`SKIP`** — nothing to validate.
- `OPERATOR-BLOCKED`: none. VPN live path needs operator `.ovpn` credentials but
  the code path is implemented and compose-config-testable, so it is
  `PENDING_FORENSICS`, not blocked.

### §-anchors

- **§11.4.153** — per-feature Status + Status_Summary set with mandatory real-use
  video confirmation; adds DOCX to the export set for this class.
- **§11.4.107** — no frozen/stale-frame video proof; videos (once recorded) must
  show live, advancing real-use content.
- **§11.4.6** — no-guessing: every row reconciled against real code; no
  unproven PASS; no faked confirmation.
- **§11.4.45 / §11.4.56 / §11.4.44 / §11.4.65** — status-doc maintenance,
  two-audience summary, revision header, multi-format export.

### Video-confirmation status (load-bearing honest fact)

Per §11.4.153, EVERY user-visible confirmed claim must be backed by a recorded
real-use capture. At Revision 6 exactly **SEVEN** Video-Confirmation cells are real
PASSes across six surfaces — SIX render/transcript + ONE flow — each backed by a
`ytdlp---`-prefixed artifact (§11.4.154/.155) under
`/Volumes/T7/Downloads/Recordings/` and analyzed by Claude Opus 4.8 native
multimodal (the strong-model path; local CPU vision rejected — see
`docs/research/vision-path/FINDINGS.md`):

- `ytdlp---dashboard---20260615T221723Z.png` — Dashboard UI render.
- `ytdlp---landing---20260616T074850Z.png` — landing 'Боба' UI render.
- `ytdlp---metube---20260616T075608Z.png` — MeTube UI render (real Completed table).
- `ytdlp---postprocess---20260616T075648Z.png` — postprocess status API render
  (live healthy JSON, 1 running / 25 done).
- `ytdlp---status---20260616T075901Z.txt` — `./status` CLI transcript (all 5 HTTP
  health checks body-matched).
- `ytdlp---download-cli---20260616T080936Z.txt` — `./download` CLI render (usage
  banner + detected `podman` runtime + wired `podman exec yt-dlp-cli yt-dlp`).
- `ytdlp---webready-flow---20260616T080633Z.txt` — **download→webready FLOW**:
  live pipeline `done` counter 25→26 across two real `/api/postprocess/status`
  snapshots + ffprobe-validated just-produced artifact (h264, 1920×1080, 7135s,
  faststart=YES, 3.34 GB). Backend pipeline (no UI) → §11.4.69/.107 sink-side
  evidence is the validated artifact, not a screen recording.

The first five are scope=render/transcript; the sixth is the first **flow**
confirmation. The MP3-derivation and cookie-upload end-to-end FLOWS are NOT yet
video-confirmed (§11.4.153 render-only ≠ flow-confirmed). Every other row carries
`Video-Confirmation = PENDING — not yet recorded`. This is the truthful state
(§11.4.2 / §11.4.5 / §11.4.6 / §11.4.107), not a stub.

### Built-vs-planned (reconciled 2026-06-16, Rev 4)

The `media_postprocessor` sidecar, web-ready transcode, MP3 derivation, and
post-process status API are **built and shipped** in tag `ytdlp-1.4.0` — verified
as FACT: real package `media_postprocessor/` (config/jobs_db/media_probe/
transcoder/watcher/worker/service), compose service `media_postprocessor`
(`MP_PORT=8089`), nginx proxy `dashboard/nginx.conf.template:116`
`/api/postprocess/` → `media-postprocessor:8089`, a live endpoint returning real
JSON, and 6+ real `webready-*.mp4` on disk. They are §7 of `Status.md`. The ONLY
remaining `Planned` / `SKIP` rows (§8) are the dashboard pipeline-status UI
(`find dashboard/src/app -iname '*postprocess*' -o -iname '*pipeline*'` → none) and
a user-facing download-resume feature.
